      <h3>Part 3: Time of War</h3>
      <h4>ü§¨ Family Feud</h4>
      <p>
        In the night before their journey, Francois is alone in his tent, Inar faces bullying while stealing tech, and
        Etta is tasked by Sister Bot
        to care for Francois, with Cu making preparations. The next day, they board a train at the dock, joined by Thabi
        and others directed by Stop,
        Shout, and Silent. Zia pilots the train, while chaos erupts as they encounter Totem Guardians. Learning of a
        custody battle over Zia,
        they refuse to bomb Perriwick, denounce the war, and redirect the train to Aliel's tower.
        Francois contacts Sister Bot, who confirms knowledge of Zia and their ongoing planetary attack before
        communication is lost amid reports
        of an animated Yggdrasil.
      </p>
      <h4>‚öîÔ∏è Rings of Ascension</h4>
      <p>
        Boris, recently exiled, awakens in the arena with injuries and his stolen warhammer held by Mortal.
        Mitch tames a cat child named Sior, while Nicholas observes from the stands among strange beings.
        Aqua Leila unveils herself and Eidolon Aramis, as baby slimes flood the arena causing havoc.
        They battle fiercely, aided by robotic entities between rounds. In the second round, a Cubegg (Dismembered One)
        attacks Nicholas,
        forcing them to fight together. Mortal retreats into his shell, Boris withstands massive damage, and they
        eventually defeat the Cubegg.
        Leila induces sleep and vanishes, shrinking the protective dome. A spider witch appears, transforming Mitch
        briefly before Nicholas shoots
        her with bullets made from slime babies. Robotic entities swarm, Sior assists Mitch, and they escape outside.
        Mitch defeats the spider witch and potentially gains a vampire slave. Using the witch's skin, they unlock a
        door, revealing a
        staircase where Leila and Aramis ascend. They enter, greeted by the words "Welcome, House of Amusement," amid
        the sight of drained
        bodies and a sinister ascent.
      </p>
      <h4>üå≤ Sleeping Yggdrasil</h4>
      <p>
        In secluded Gardenia, where inhabitants trust the process and keep to themselves, Gingko, Gumball, and Edvard
        are sent on a mission to
        investigate the new Yggdrasil tree's mysterious disturbance. Along the way, they encounter Pamela and Milva and
        recall a story told by the Visitor.
        At the tree, they find it broken into and face its antibodies, only stopping them by sacrificing Edvard to
        become a vaccine.
        The tree's calm release of fireflies and will o wisps inadvertently aligns with Perricks's magic. As the tree
        awakens and moves, they meet
        Albedo Sentinel, who leads them to Noir's suspended crystal. They confront Kai, a merman guardian, learning the
        stolen sleep is gathered by a
        book, which Noir takes control of, directing the tree to the Tower of God. Riding atop the tree, they encounter
        Aqua Leila and Aramis,
        then twins at the tower's entrance.

      <h3>Part 4: A Time Above, and Within</h3>
      <h4>üåå House of Stars</h4>
      <h5>Part 1</h5>
      <p>
        Leila Noir confronts Aqua Leila, leading their battle into a House, while the twins also seek refuge inside.
        An eidolon enters the House of Warfare, hinting at impending conflict. The book of Ro'o unveils plans to merge
        the tower and tree,
        prompting Albedo Sentinel to promise an army upon completion. Gumbol takes Kai, and Gingko brings Pamela to the
        House of Stars,
        where the book vanishes into the celestial observatory. They witness a vision of Le√≠th's demise and her
        transformation into an eidolon.
        The players combat the Children of Creations, learning of Casimir and Le√≠th's tragic past. Gumbol accidentally
        kills Kai with a telescope,
        uncovering secrets from Casimir's grimoire, including his powerful magic and forbidden love. They discover
        sketches depicting armoured mice
        and mysterious monitors, along with a glimpse of the ongoing battle in the Rift. In the place where Le√≠th once
        died, they find only scorch
        marks and an ancient picture of her and Casimir, portraying a time of innocence and hope.

      <h5>Part 2</h5>
      <p>
        As our players delve into the grimoire, they stumble upon a mysterious summoning circle connected to the
        Eidolon, Aramis,
        who arrives with another Child of Creation and Pamela. A battle ensues, with the Eidolon focusing on retrieving
        the book from Milva.
        After defeating the Child, they free the Eidolon from its bindings, only to be surprised by the arrival of
        another Eidolon, the Voidweaver.
        Milva realizes this is the Eidolon she made a pact with, who returns her lost sheep as promised. The players
        learn more about both Eidolons:
        the Voidweaver, a former soldier seeking his lost squadmates, and Aramis, one of the Three Musketeers who fell
        into the Rift and became
        enslaved by Aqua Leila. They also uncover details about the Ascension Order, linked to the creation of the Rift,
        and Aqua Leila's pursuit of it.
        Determined to restore Ty Aur without sacrificing Aliel, they rest in the observatory, only to find a war raging
        outside between the Audience of
        the Library and the Yggdrasil Tree's forces, with the Rift portal expanding ominously in the sky.

        Boris, Mitch, Mortal, and Nicholas ascend the spiral staircase toward the tower, noticing the Eidolon ascending
        as well.
        A large tree collides with the tower, initiating their merger. At the top, they find four doors and a balcony
        leading to the tree.
        Inside the House of War, they experience a vision of a female eidolon exploding amidst screens. They witness
        various scenes on the monitors,
        including a tiefling being tortured, a rogue train pursued by a jellyfish army, and a frozen image of the Orca
        hurled by the Consciousness.
        A recording hints at chaos and loss, urging Francois to find solace with Athos and Etta. Using the flesh of the
        spider witch, they enter a
        vast library and encounter Halo and Eclipse, engaging in a difficult battle. Nocturna, Mitch's new vampire
        thrall, joins the fray to aid them.

        As the players guide the train towards the tower, they feel the weight of the surrounding crystal fields. Zia
        disembarks,
        opening the barrier for the train to park inside. Within the cottage, they are transported into Aliel's dream,
        where they discover
        trapped souls living in limbo. They encounter Moss Leila, who shares the world's history, revealing the Leila
        cycle's origins, Aqua Leila's
        pivotal role, and the lineage of Dormant, Perriwinkle, and their descendants. Moss and Aliel disclose Aliel's
        prophetic abilities and the
        dilemma of awakening or eliminating the Consciousness's sane side to avert Ty Aur's destruction. Inar receives a
        rune from Aliel to tame the
        mind beast guarding the Consciousness, setting the stage for their next encounter with the enigmatic figure
        himself.
